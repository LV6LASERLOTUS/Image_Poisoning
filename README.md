# Comparison of IVT,SVD watermarking vs CMUA/FOUND on jpg and png

###  Description:

Nowadays with the growth of AI, our personal data is becoming more and more prone to use as training data and for production of deepfakes, both without our consent. Therefore, to counter such attacks a watermarking method aimed toward the neural network models used for such nonconsensual data scraping is needed, but at the same time this watermarking method should not degrade image quality itself. Therefore, in this project, we aim to test out two broad categories of watermarking techniques to protect images against training and deepfakes by AI.
