# Comparison of IVT,SVD watermarking vs CMUA/FOUND on jpg and png

###  Description:

Nowadays with the growth of AI or personal data are becoming more andmore prone to being use as training data and deepfake. Therefore to counter such attacks a need for a watermarking aim toward these models is needed, at the same time not affecting the image quality itself.Therefore in this project we aim to test out the two broad categories of watermarking techniques to protect images against training.
