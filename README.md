# Comparison of IVT,SVD watermarking vs CMUA/FOUND on jpg and png

###  Description

Nowadays with the growth of AI or personal data are becoming more andmore prone to being use as training data and deepfake. Therefore to counter such attacks a need for a watermarking aim toward these models is needed, at the same time not affecting the image quality itself.
Therefore in this project we aim to test out the two broad categories of watermarking techniques to protect images against training. Firstly is the FOUND propose method proposed in the research [Feature Extraction Matters More](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.00200). Second is the method mentioned in Natured scientific report [Secure and flexible image watermarking using IWT, SVD, and chaos models for robustness and imperceptibility](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-91876-2). We aim to compare these two method in aspect of effectiveness and quality.
